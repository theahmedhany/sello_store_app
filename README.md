# Sello: Store App
A new Flutter Application.


## Description
I am pleased to introduce **Sello**, a sophisticated Flutter-based Store application designed to deliver a seamless and dynamic shopping experience by leveraging API integrations. With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, the app offers users a comprehensive range of features to enhance their shopping journey.

This Store application showcases my expertise in fetching and displaying products from a real API using various Flutter packages, resulting in a polished and functional Store App.


## Technologies Used
- **HTTP Package:** Employed to fetch data from the API, ensuring real-time product updates.
- **Cached Images:** Integrated to optimize image loading and improve overall app performance.
- **Future Builder:** Utilized to create widgets dynamically based on the API response.
- **API Requests:** Implemented three distinct requests for fetching all products, all categories, and updated products.
- **Reusable Components:** Developed to ensure consistency and efficiency across the app's interface.


## About
Sello is more than just a store application; it's a demonstration of the power of Flutter and modern API integrations. By focusing on user experience and app performance, I was able to create an app that not only meets the needs of users but also sets a standard for quality in mobile app development. This project challenged me to apply and expand upon the knowledge gained from my previous app development experiences.
